# euro-conversion-predictor
Python script that predicts and visualizes the euroâ€™s conversion rate with four global currencies (USD, GBP, AUD, JPY) using historical exchange data. While the KNN model captures past trends, its predictive power is limited, as currency rates are influenced by real-world economic and sociopolitical events that are not reflected in historical patterns alone.
